We had to create an arcade game using an handmade custom controller. We decided to make a game in which you pilot a ship that can jump on waves and do tricks in the air, SSX style. All of that using a steering wheel made of papier-mache and a mouse. The game is made using Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprint). I loved working on this project, since it was using an alternative controller. Programming the player's behaviour was a totally different thing since I had to take the weird controller into account."
